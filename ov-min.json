Among them was Ana Amari, who was widely considered to be the world's best. Her superior marksmanship, decision-making, and instincts made her a natural selection to join the Overwatch strike team that would end the war. Following the success of Overwatch's original mission, Ana served for many years as Strike Commander Morrison's second-in-command. Despite her responsibilities in leading the organization, Ana refused to step away from combat operations. She remained on active duty well into her fifties, until she was believed to have been killed during a hostage rescue mission by the Talon operative known as Widowmaker.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt26f888b741ac09bb/638807c1113983111ba8cfa9/ana_00.jpg"},{"title":"Post overwatch","content":"In truth, Ana survived that encounter, despite being gravely wounded and losing her right eye. During her recovery, she wrestled with the weight of a life spent in combat, and she chose to stay out of the world's growing conflicts.

Ana rejoined the fight, this time as a healer, and dedicated herself to monitoring global security threats.

She sent word to Cole Cassidy, knowing that he had survived the demise of Overwatch and returned as a gunslinger for hire. Ana knew the organization needed new blood—people like Cassidy and her daughter, Pharah—were it to stand a chance, and worried the old guard would only poison the agency’s return. She shared as much with her daughter in an overdue reunion, before embarking on her own mission with Soldier: 76.

Her parents owned the Arbalest Arms Company, a family business which had grown in power and scope during the Omnic Crisis. While the couple had little interest in weaponry or tech, they had become highly sought-after business consultants and coaches for the global elite. Though her parents paid little attention to her (mostly leaving her in the care of the family’s omnic butler, B.O.B., they ensured that Ashe had every opportunity to succeed. But a chance meeting with a local ruffian named Cole Cassidy, and an impromptu string of crimes committed together, opened her eyes to her true calling.

Her actions ultimately attracted the attention of Overwatch, who busted the gang early into their exploits, taking Cassidy into custody. The Deadlock Gang’s rapid rise to prominence put them at odds with more than just law enforcement, too. The other criminal organizations in the American Southwest wanted a piece of their pie; the encounters often became violent. After years of skirmishes and bloodshed, Ashe called the heads of the major groups together. Ashe saw the potential to grow the influence of all. She used what she’d learned from her parents’ business to bring order to these groups. Her proposal was that the gangs could work together (or at least, not work against each other). No longer having to focus her energies on squabbles with the other gangs, Ashe wrote her name across the American Southwest with a string of audacious heists and operations that cemented her legacy as an outlaw legend. Her principles? Keep your word, don’t work with the law, respect each other’s territory, and always punish betrayal. Speaking of which, some decades after Cole Cassidy turned coat for Overwatch, the Deadlock Rebels received a tip regarding precious tech moving across their turf via hypertrain. Too lucrative to ignore, the gang planned a train heist, only to learn they were the ones being robbed. Cassidy incapacitated the gang and released Echo into the world, singlehandedly stealing Ashe’s bike, her score, and her shot at revenge. But in these uncertain times, one thing is certain: Ashe gets what she wants. And she and her Deadlock Rebels won't stop until they claim what's theirs (and likely, what's yours).","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt811b34d14ae2f336/63880844c72c2b107a6f7dd4/ashe-01.jpg"}]}},{"heroKey":"baptiste","name":"Baptiste","description":"An elite combat medic and ex-Talon operative, Baptiste now uses his skills to help those whose lives have been impacted by war.","portrait":"https://d15f34w2p8l1cc.cloudfront.net/overwatch/f979896f74ba22db2a92a85ae1260124ab0a26665957a624365e0f96e5ac5b5c.png","role":"support","location":"Tortuga, Haiti (formerly), Watchpoint: Gibraltar","birthday":"Mar 12","age":38,"hitpoints":{"health":250,"shields":0,"armor":0,"total":250},"abilities":[{"name":"Biotic Launcher","description":"Three-round burst gun.

To survive, Baptiste agreed, but when Baptiste found out the man had valuable intel about Overwatch, he saved him. His old friend, Mauga, gave Baptiste one final chance to return to Talon outside of a body bag, but he refused, escaping with the valuable intel: the list of names and locations to which Winston had broadcast Overwatch’s Recall. The hit list of known and likely Overwatch agents spurred Baptiste to warn those unfortunate enough to find their names on it, beginning with Dr. Angela Ziegler. In his efforts to locate Ziegler, Baptiste instead crossed paths with a suspicious Cassidy on his own mission to recruit global heroes for a renewed Overwatch. As Cassidy and Baptiste fell within Talon's crosshairs, their chance encounter and unlikely partnership gave Baptiste a chance at the redemption he sought.

But during the Omnic Crisis, they were turned against their human makers, forming the bulk of the omnics' rebel army. Following the resolution of the crisis, nearly all of them were destroyed or disassembled. To this day, Bastion units still symbolize the horrors of the conflict. One unique Bastion unit, severely damaged in the final battles of the war, was left forgotten for over a decade. He lay dormant, exposed to the elements and rusting while nature slowly reclaimed him. Overgrown with vines and roots and nested upon by small animals, the robot sat inert, seemingly unaware of the passing of time. That was until one fateful day, when he unexpectedly reactivated. With his combat programming all but lost, he instead displayed an intense curiosity about the natural world and its inhabitants. This inquisitive Bastion unit set out to explore his surroundings and discover his purpose on a war-ravaged planet. Though \"Bastion\" appears to be gentle—even harmless, at times—his core combat programming takes over when the unit senses danger, utilizing his entire arsenal to eliminate anything he perceives as a threat. This led to instances of conflict with the few humans he encountered and drove him to avoid populated areas in favor of the wild, uncharted regions of the world.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt907d9513bdbf532e/638808a9113983111ba8cfaf/bastion-00.jpg"},{"title":"Torbjörn","content":"In his wanderings, Bastion appeared in northern Sweden, where his discovery ignited old fears in the populace.

Torbjörn freed Bastion from much of his wartime programming and conducted major repairs on several of Bastion’s decades-old, crumbling systems.

Everyone expected that Brigitte would continue her apprenticeship and follow in her father's footsteps. But her plans changed due to the influence of another prominent figure in her life, her father's fellow Overwatch agent, Reinhardt Wilhelm.

In his overenthusiasm, Reinhardt nearly lost the fight. Brigitte did her best to repair his armor with minimal parts, and bandage up her mentor, as his body was breaking down from years of combat. Though Reinhardt was triumphant against the Dragons, Brigitte realized that serving only as a mechanic wasn't enough and that the best way she could continue on their journey was to become a warrior in her own right. While Reinhardt trained her in combat, Brigitte built her own suit of armor. The Overwatch Recall brought them from the ruins of Eichenwald to the streets of Paris, where Brigitte fought at Reinhardt's side to protect him, and any others in need, from the ravages of Null Sector.

Before long, Adeyemi’s protégé made a fateful choice for the good of Talon. Ogundimu slayed his mentor, and assumed the mantle of Doomfist—taking on both the infamous weapon and the name. Talon understood the new Doomfist was an unmatched strategist, capable of leading both Talon’s military arm and its dealings that required more subterfuge. He would be the perfect replacement, and the rest of the organization began to fall in line. Under Doomfist, Talon underwent a significant transformation to become not just a ubiquitous shadow presence throughout the world, but a private military organization as well. This would prove a difficult balancing act, yet Doomfist was sure that they could always influence, obfuscate, or terminate any who got too close to the truth.\n Eight years prior to Null Sector’s global assault, Doomfist was captured by an Overwatch strike team that included Tracer, Winston, and Genji. He was imprisoned in a maximum-security facility, where he waited patiently for his plots to play out. It was only when he sensed the time had come that he broke out of his prison and recovered his gauntlet. Now, Doomfist has retaken his place in Talon, ready to drive the organization and humanity to its natural point of refinement through global

The massive, lumbering construct caused catastrophic damage to coastal cities before it was driven back beneath the waves. In response, the South Korean government developed a mechanized armored drone unit, called MEKA, to protect urban environments in future engagements with the omnic threat. The government's fears proved to be well founded, as a disturbing pattern of attacks emerged. Every few years, the monstrosity would rise from the sea to assault South Korea and its neighbors. The threat learned from these encounters, often reconfiguring itself in a different form and appearing with new weapons and capabilities. Each incident ended in a stalemate, with the monstrosity defeated but not destroyed.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt61b8f52c5724688d/638809023cbefd11108111d1/dva-00.jpg"},{"title":"Meka squad","content":"As the threat continued to adapt, it eventually disrupted MEKA's drone-control networks, forcing the military to place pilots in the mechs. Scrambling to find suitable candidates, the government turned to the country's professional gamers, who possessed the necessary reflexes and instincts to operate the mechs' advanced weapons systems. Top stars willingly joined the effort via the nation's compulsory military service, including reigning world champion Hana Song, also known as \"D.Va.\" Famous for her elite skills, D.Va was a fierce competitor who played to win at all costs, and she had a well-earned reputation for showing no mercy to her opponents. D.Va quickly grew in skill to become MEKA’s top pilot, even streaming combat operations to her adoring fans, but the Gwishin threats’ increasing attacks on South Korea began to take a heavy toll on the MEKA squad.

Prior to joining the organization, Liao was widely considered one of the preeminent experts in the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence, and an employee of Omnica Corporation. There she worked on the team that was responsible for the design and creation of the omnics that would later wage war against humanity during the Omnic Crisis. Ultimately, it was this expertise that led her to be recruited into Overwatch to help stop her creations. Even that catastrophe was not enough to dissuade Liao of her firmly held belief in the potential of artificial life and its power to transform the world for the better. After the Crisis, she dreamed of improving upon the original omnic designs, but Overwatch’s restrictions on artificial intelligence research and development forced her to limit the parameters of her new Echo project. Instead, she created a multirole, adaptive robot that could be programmed to learn different functions—anything from medical support to construction—but had serious limits to its independent decision-making, including multiple layers of protections, fail-safes, and security to keep it under control. Echo was used successfully on test missions alongside Overwatch strike teams, but Overwatch leadership was reluctant to put it into full service.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt2732d775e1abb0e9/6388092a6f080311223b5518/echo-00.jpg"},{"title":"Overwatch","content":"However, the truth was that Liao had programmed Echo with a powerful, general artificial intelligence that learned by observation. After thousands of hours in the scientist’s presence, much of Liao’s behaviors (including her speech), were adopted by the Echo robot. This secret was known by very few, including Blackwatch agent Cole Cassidy, who had, at times, been assigned to guard the scientist. When Liao was killed in an attack on an Overwatch facility, Overwatch’s leadership feared the potential of such a robot without Liao’s careful stewardship. All development on Echo was shut down, and the robot was placed into quarantine. Having been freed by Cole Cassidy from an attempted heist by the Deadlock Gang, Echo joined up with the new Overwatch team to defend Paris against the Null Sector incursion. For the first time, Echo is seeing action as a full-fledged team member.

As the eldest son of the family's head, Hanzo was bound by duty to succeed his father and rule the Shimada empire. From a young age, he was trained for that responsibility, displaying a natural aptitude for leadership and possessing an innate understanding of strategy and tactics. He also excelled in more practical areas: he was a prodigy in martial arts, swordplay, and bowmanship, having trained under swordmaster Asa Yamagami, mother of Kiriko Kamori. Upon the death of his father, the clan elders instructed Hanzo to straighten out his wayward younger brother, Genji, so that he, too, might help rule the Shimada empire.

Together they taught Dez the rules of the wasteland, how to operate in a group, and how to survive the irradiated Outback. For those living in the shadow of the ruined Australian omnium, the Omnic Crisis never really ended, it just took a different shape. The survivors and descendants of the ALF and the omnics who roamed the outback clashed in an unending battle for land and resources.

Though the scientists were busy with their duties on the base, they made every effort to keep Juno entertained and happy through her childhood. Even so, it seemed their curiosity had rubbed off on her, and she constantly begged to join them on expeditions outside of the base. When she was finally old enough, her mother gifted her a modified Lucheng space suit so she could safely brave the Martian atmosphere.

To make matters worse, their attempts to contact Lucheng Interstellar received no response, and the second wave of Project Red Promise never arrived.

After all, she embodied their hope for the future of humanity. They would not let her share their same fate. \nBut  Juno was not one to give up on the only home and family  she’d ever known. Rather than seeing her departure as an evacuation, she made it her mission to find help on Earth. With solemn goodbyes,  Juno tearfully left the danger of her home planet,  knowing there was a chance she would never see her family again. She promised herself she’d find someone who could help her save everyone – before it was too late. \nWhile growing up, Juno had heard many stories of her mother’s life on Earth, including those of an old friend: a climatologist named Dr. Mei Ling Zhou.

From a young age, he resisted the structured life they had planned for him. He preferred wandering his compound’s vast walled garden, mending plants alongside his family’s gardeners. Even early on, he was too intelligent for the expensive schools his family could afford. He often completed assignments incorrectly (his teachers often complained) by solving problems more thoroughly than was necessary, or in new ways that hinted at his brilliant future. His parents, desperate to instill order in Niran, sent him to the prestigious Vishkar Architech Academy.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt1304d88705fbf47a/64236a72bad30b6ff457346c/lifeweaver-01.jpg"},{"title":"Roommates","content":"Niran developed an almost immediate distaste for both the rigid, artificial beauty that Vishkar called “perfection”.

In those journeys, he was struck by the turmoil that existed outside of his perfect bubble of wealth. All around the world, people needed help. Illness, injury, and many other ailments riddled communities with pain—a pain Niran grew determined to fix.  Using the academy’s resources and his parents’ influence, Niran set about on his own project—one that would help him heal the world.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt1be39a76b546e64c/64236a72a3e9c24dffdfd035/lifeweaver-03.jpg"},{"title":"Hard light","content":"In his research, he discovered that the late founder of Vishkar had hoped to provide his hard light freely to the world before Vishkar implemented more restrictions to the technology.

Alone and hunted, Niran has turned to the Atlantic Arcology, a freestanding and self-sustaining scientific and ecological city in the Atlantic Ocean, free from the governing laws of any nation on the planet.

The technology radically improved the treatment of life-threatening illnesses and injuries. It was this expertise that attracted the attention of Overwatch. Because her parents had been taken by war, Ziegler was opposed to the organization's militaristic approach to keeping global peace. Ultimately, she recognized that Overwatch offered her the opportunity to save lives on a much larger scale. As Overwatch's head of medical research, Ziegler sought to leverage her work for healing in frontline crises. The result was the Valkyrie swift-response suit, which Ziegler herself piloted on many Overwatch missions. Despite her contributions to Overwatch, she was often at odds with her superiors and the organization's overarching aims. Though she lent her brilliant mind to healing her comrades, Ziegler had dire concerns about the affairs of Blackwatch, specifically pertaining to Commander Reyes and his own medical support, Moira O’Deorain. When Overwatch dissolved, Ziegler sought distance from the agency and re-dedicated herself to helping those affected by war, caring for the broken and dispossessed in crisis areas around the world.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt12c536b770bfdcd4/63880edf443fa70e71d4bfcd/mercy-00.jpg"},{"title":"Post overwatch","content":"Following the Overwatch Recall, two squad mates she had thought to be dead and gone arrived at her doorstep: Jack Morrison and Ana Amari.

Yet, when Talon forces descended on Cairo, Mercy appeared without fail, to protect the city’s civilians alongside her old teammates. Although she, Soldier: 76, and Ana Amari have since parted ways, the events in Cairo rekindled a sense of heroism that Ziegler had thought to be long buried. With Null Sector's targeted attack on Paris, it was clear that Overwatch was needed once again to defend the world from threats to peace. Now knowing her battle is not yet over, Mercy has since returned to Overwatch, and can be counted on to don her Valkyrie suit whenever innocents are imperiled.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt9d92a71c1b2111fc/63880edf3b13b1106f74ec5c/mercy-01.jpg"}]}},{"heroKey":"moira","name":"Moira","description":"Equal parts brilliant and controversial, scientist Moira O'Deorain is on the cutting edge of genetic engineering, searching for a way to rewrite the fundamental building blocks of life.","portrait":"https://d15f34w2p8l1cc.cloudfront.net/overwatch/000beeb5606e01497897fa9210dd3b1e78e1159ebfd8afdc9e989047d7d3d08f.png","role":"support","location":"Oasis, Iraq","birthday":"Apr 4","age":50,"hitpoints":{"health":250,"shields":0,"armor":0,"total":250},"abilities":[{"name":"Biotic Grasp","description":"Hold to heal all allies in front of you.

While Efi was a superfan of Lúcio's music, Lúcio was a superfan of Efi’s ingenuity. He agreed to perform a benefit concert in Numbani for the victims of Doomfist’s attack. During Lúcio's concert in Unity Square, Talon struck. Orisa teamed up with Lúcio to defend the concertgoers from Doomfist, who was determined to sow fear in the populace. While Orisa, Efi, and Lúcio succeeded in protecting Numbani, they knew peace was a gift to be carefully guarded. After expelling Talon from Numbani, Efi and Orisa met with former Overwatch Commander Sojourn about what it meant to be a hero. Efi took Sojourn’s words to heart and used the experience to think out new upgrades for Orisa. As Orisa continues to grow with her brilliant creator at her side, one thing seems certain: Numbani’s future is in good hands.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt92fe22c967d136bc/63880f12e5d09810cdaff697/orisa-01.jpg"}]}},{"heroKey":"pharah","name":"Pharah","description":"Fareeha Amari's commitment to duty runs in her blood.

Still, Fareeha enlisted in the Egyptian army, and her dogged persistence and tactical prowess caused her to rise up through the officer ranks.

Years after her mother’s death, Fareeha was shocked to receive a letter from Ana, stating that she was alive, but unable to return to her. Fareeha was confused, angry, and disappointed; Ana’s pattern of choosing her mission over her daughter had damaged Fareeha’s trust in her.

After the Crisis, Ramattra heard rumors of a mysterious omnic named Aurora—the first of their kind. Intrigued and seeking direction, Ramattra embarked on a pilgrimage to the Shambali Monastery in Nepal, a place where Aurora was said to have resided. Ramattra survived the harsh journey and was welcomed by Tekhartha Mondatta. Choosing to become a monk of the Shambali, Ramattra studied under Mondatta for years, learning about the Iris—the mysterious phenomenon at the heart of the monks’ teachings—and the importance of coexisting with humans. Years later, Ramattra began venturing outside the temple seeking enlightenment. It was on one of his journeys that he met an omnic named Zenyatta whom he guided to Shambali, in hopes the omnic would find purpose there as he did. However, as time wore on, Ramattra failed to see true progress in the monks’ mission of peace. The Shambali urged Ramattra to be patient, but all around him, Ramattra saw his people dying . . . and no one taking action.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt78cb18afb596ea4a/661d69531b47244a622d7741/Ramattra_-_Shambali.jpg"},{"title":"Null sector","content":"Ramattra knew he could follow the Shambali teachings no longer.

Ramattra initially focused on building loyalty in his followers, but true radicalization and militarization would not be far behind. Soon Ramattra’s forces were large enough to warrant a test. The target was London, to liberate the omnics there and see how his forces would perform to a world nearly two decades after the Omnic Crisis. Null Sector was ultimately defeated by Overwatch, a scenario Ramattra did not anticipate since Overwatch was forbidden to operate in the country. In addition, the omnics of London did not support the sacrifices on their behalf, going so far as to denounce the actions of Null Sector. It’s been years since Ramattra—or Null Sector—was last seen. But now, for reasons unknown, Null Sector has appeared in the skies over Paris, Busan, and Rio.

In Venice, where the body of Talon leader Augusto Vialli was found amid the carnage.

Survivors have described a black shadow ghosting unscathed through the most hellish battlefields. The few bodies recovered of those he kills are pale, empty husks drained of life, their cells showing signs of intense degradation. It is possible that he is a byproduct of failed genetic alteration which forces his cells to simultaneously decay and regenerate at a hyper-accelerated rate. Those tracking his movements have begun to see a pattern in his appearances. They believe that the Reaper is hunting former Overwatch agents and systematically eliminating them, a hypothesis supported by his infiltration of Watchpoint: Gibraltar, where he sought a list of the names and locations of former Overwatch agents.

Reinhardt became part of the original Overwatch strike team that put an end to the Omnic Crisis.

Reinhardt's unique ethics and larger-than-life persona earned the admiration of his peers and superiors alike.

But in the wake of the Omnic Crisis, the government made a controversial move, gifting the land to the omnics who had nearly destroyed their country, in hopes of establishing a long-term peace accord. This agreement permanently displaced Mako and a large number of the area's residents: a scattered collection of survivalists, solar farmers, and people who just wanted to be left alone. Furious over the loss of their homes, Mako and the residents turned to violent rebellion. They formed the Australian Liberation Front and struck against the omnium and its robot population to take back the lands that had been stolen from them. Events continued to escalate until the ALF sabotaged the omnium's fusion core, which resulted in an explosion that destroyed the omnium, irradiated the surrounding area, and littered the Outback with twisted metal and wreckage for miles around. Mako watched as his home became an apocalyptic wasteland, and he was forever changed. Adapting to his environment, he donned a mask and took to the broken highways of the Outback on his ramshackle chopper. Little by little, his humanity was forgotten. The last vestiges of Mako faded away and the ruthless killer Roadhog was born.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blta1267b8aa2078ce1/637da1d146a48b0e063e4a9d/roadhog-00.jpg"},{"title":"Junker","content":"Roadhog set up shop on the outskirts of Junkertown, a thorn in the side of the town’s reigning monarch, the Junker Queen.

Born with a rare, terminal auto-immune disease that caused her body to attack its own organs, Vivian spent much of her childhood and teenaged years in and out of hospitals. Her parents had gotten her interested in military strategy from a young age, so she spent hours reading books and playing strategy simulations while recovering from various surgical procedures. Her case eventually caught the attention of Elaine Esat, a doctor pioneering a highly experimental treatment for Vivian’s disease. As part of the treatment, Vivian had her affected organs and limbs replaced with state-of-the-art cybernetic ones. The treatments gave Vivian a new life. Vivian followed in her parents’ footsteps and became an officer in the Canadian Armed Forces, where she gained a reputation as a tactical ace. At the start of the Omnic Crisis, she was conscripted into Special Forces . Her daring strategies—which often played out deep behind enemy lines—saved countless lives, and her squad nicknamed her “Sojourn.”","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/bltb0acd4d16796ee01/637da1daf9f61910b423578d/sojourn-00.jpg"},{"title":"Overwatch","content":"When Canada was in its darkest hour, Vivian’s unit partnered with the nascent Overwatch, working with Jack Morrison, Torbjörn Lindholm, and Dr. Mina Liao to push the omnic forces out of Toronto. The combined efforts of Sojourn and Overwatch not only repelled the omnics from Canada, but also led to the decommissioning of the Detroit Omnium, a major victory for humanity. Vivian received numerous commendations for heroism and leadership, but after the war, she still felt her mission wasn’t over. She requested a transfer to a counterterrorism unit within the Canadian Special Forces, where she helped with the takedown of Ontario United, an anti-omnic hate group. Sojourn’s skills and her commitment to the rule of law proved she was exactly what Overwatch needed in a post-Crisis world. Morrison recruited her with the promise that her position could make a global difference. She soon gained a reputation as an empathetic, clear-headed tactician with exceptional concern for the people she led into battle. Vivian spent a considerable amount of time with Overwatch’s ground troops as well, and over time, she became one of Overwatch’s most trusted leaders.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt1582595d3bc7019a/637da1da6f080311223b5406/sojourn-01.jpg"},{"title":"Fall of overwatch","content":"However, the longer Vivian spent with Overwatch, the less satisfied she became with its politics. She felt that the organization had lost its way.. She said as much when the United Nations launched an internal investigation of Overwatch, which culminated in a series of public hearings. Vivian spoke truthfully about her experiences, and her testimony proved pivotal in passing the Petras Act and ending Overwatch. After the hearings, Vivian settled into early, uneasy retirement with her rescue dog, Murphy. The cybernetic hero who saved Canada from threat after threat has earned herself some peace. But Vivian Chase was never one who fought for glory—she fought because she was needed, and should that need arise again, Sojourn will meet it.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt97fa68ff5a991d80/637da1da5148880e83ab6fd3/sojourn-02.jpg"}]}},{"heroKey":"soldier-76","name":"Soldier: 76","description":"The target of an international manhunt, the vigilante known as Soldier: 76 wages a personal war to expose the truth behind Overwatch's collapse.","portrait":"https://d15f34w2p8l1cc.cloudfront.net/overwatch/20b4ef00ed05d6dba75df228241ed528df7b6c9556f04c8070bad1e2f89e0ff5.png","role":"damage","location":"Unknown","birthday":"Jan 27","age":58,"hitpoints":{"health":250,"shields":0,"armor":0,"total":250},"abilities":[{"name":"Heavy Pulse Rifle","description":"Automatic assault weapon.","icon":"https://d15f34w2p8l1cc.cloudfront.net/overwatch/69eaf669cd646a617439592615f023cfec82c27f4a3e19f48188941b3feaf55f.png","video":{"thumbnail":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt1b07ff0fa9c82c0a/63390893425ea374105b618d/SOLDIER76_Heavy_Pulse_Rifle.jpg","link":{"mp4":"https://assets.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt261970a870f0154b/63390898399a07678557c175/OVERWATCH_WEBSITE_CHARACTER_CAPTURE_Soldier76HeavyPulseRifle_WEB_16x9_1920x1080p30_H264.mp4","webm":"https://assets.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt7c63bec32b82c060/633908987e84e17596f9c8e0/OVERWATCH_WEBSITE_CHARACTER_CAPTURE_Soldier76HeavyPulseRifle_WEB_16x9_1920x1080p30_WEBM.webm"}}},{"name":"Sprint","description":"Run faster while moving forward.","icon":"https://d15f34w2p8l1cc.cloudfront.net/overwatch/8408bacddfb4ac7b971dd14f6d8c9d211459fb159b459c3e6eaf06bc0a38bcb2.png","video":{"thumbnail":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/bltb7ab357e8d9dca60/633908937e84e17596f9c8dc/SOLDIER76_Sprint.jpg","link":{"mp4":"https://assets.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt8eab5d6609de7c51/63390899f87c00687e8ef264/OVERWATCH_WEBSITE_CHARACTER_CAPTURE_Soldier76Sprint_WEB_16x9_1920x1080p30_H264.mp4","webm":"https://assets.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt3b4c575cb977be2f/63390899425ea374105b6191/OVERWATCH_WEBSITE_CHARACTER_CAPTURE_Soldier76Sprint_WEB_16x9_1920x1080p30_WEBM.webm"}}},{"name":"Biotic Field","description":"Deploy a field that heals you and your allies.","icon":"https://d15f34w2p8l1cc.cloudfront.net/overwatch/aaadd3dee89ac8797ecb7a1e647f574a034b1930726296fd17946d343254bdf0.png","video":{"thumbnail":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt186595f5d6bc1dc7/63390893399a07678557c171/SOLDIER76_Biotic_Field.jpg","link":{"mp4":"https://assets.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/bltf0082b2806a67b1c/633908981ccd046877c0e51d/OVERWATCH_WEBSITE_CHARACTER_CAPTURE_Soldier76BioticField_WEB_16x9_1920x1080p30_H264.mp4","webm":"https://assets.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/bltb08a250ab35c1450/63390898ed7dcc6a002803e4/OVERWATCH_WEBSITE_CHARACTER_CAPTURE_Soldier76BioticField_WEB_16x9_1920x1080p30_WEBM.webm"}}},{"name":"Helix Rockets","description":"Launch a volley of explosive rockets.","icon":"https://d15f34w2p8l1cc.cloudfront.net/overwatch/8fedb348952552227b6e2ec85cf14214106b901afce2a9657267153bb2a8cac3.png","video":{"thumbnail":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt7b433e0fd1053ce2/63390893ec7e18758be5108e/SOLDIER76_Helix_Rockets.jpg","link":{"mp4":"https://assets.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/bltb4be2f7947112247/633908981a0b5e7d3d1ec5e1/OVERWATCH_WEBSITE_CHARACTER_CAPTURE_Soldier76HelixRockets_WEB_16x9_1920x1080p30_H264.mp4","webm":"https://assets.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/bltcb6d4bd1d99354df/63390898f87c00687e8ef260/OVERWATCH_WEBSITE_CHARACTER_CAPTURE_Soldier76HelixRockets_WEB_16x9_1920x1080p30_WEBM.webm"}}},{"name":"Tactical Visor","description":"Automatically aims your weapon at targets in view.","icon":"https://d15f34w2p8l1cc.cloudfront.net/overwatch/5e8d4b8fb5cd1271314b8462012e9894c811a7c4857739e73bde53f2431e673d.png","video":{"thumbnail":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt1859d0e873547c6c/63390893da1d806602f83f26/SOLDIER76_Tactical_Visor.jpg","link":{"mp4":"https://assets.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt523a030c6808fc57/6339089964fe5a7d4481a0a8/OVERWATCH_WEBSITE_CHARACTER_CAPTURE_Soldier76TacticalVisor_WEB_16x9_1920x1080p30_H264.mp4","webm":"https://assets.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt54d3b2e6d32771fc/63390898b8dbde69f5279934/OVERWATCH_WEBSITE_CHARACTER_CAPTURE_Soldier76TacticalVisor_WEB_16x9_1920x1080p30_WEBM.webm"}}}],"story":{"summary":"The former commander of Overwatch turned physically-enhanced vigilante, Jack Morrison travels the world hunting those responsible for the downfall of Overwatch.

Few would believe that former Overwatch Strike Commander Jack Morrison is the face behind Soldier: 76, given that Morrison was presumed dead during the destruction of Overwatch’s Swiss Headquarters. But the hardened veteran survived, perhaps due to the fact that he was biologically enhanced and trained as a member of the United States Soldier Enhancement Program, a top secret agency which surfaced only during the most desperate hour of the Omnic Crisis. As such, Morrison possesses physical capabilities exceeding those of a conventional soldier's, as well as other augmentations that make him a peerless combatant.

One such city, Utopaea, was created using radical hard-light technology that enabled its architechs to shape the city's streets, utilities, and living spaces in the blink of an eye. After she was identified as one of the few capable of becoming a light-bending architech, young Satya Vaswani was plucked from extreme poverty and placed in the care of Vishkar's architech academy, never to return home. Isolated and lonely in her new life, Satya immersed herself in her education and training. She quickly grasped the applications of the technology and was one of the top students in her class. Satya approached hard-light manipulation differently than her peers, with their more procedural, mechanical constructions, instead weaving her constructs in the motions of the traditional dance of her homeland.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/bltd84a036680d83564/637da1eba86e5310c692c02b/symmetra-00.jpg"},{"title":"Architech","content":"Though she was one of Utopaea's top architechs, the Vishkar Corporation saw far greater potential in Satya's abilities. Giving her the moniker \"Symmetra,\" Vishkar sent her on clandestine missions around the world to uphold its corporate interests and expand its influence into other countries. One of these missions was in Rio de Janeiro, where Vishkar was in the running to design a new city center. The company sent Symmetra to obtain leverage to use against a rival developer, but Symmetra assured her handlers that the competition was clean. In response, Vishkar destroyed their rival’s offices, resulting in civilian casualties. Symmetra’s faith in Vishkar was further rocked by her experiences in Suravasa, where Vishkar construction had caused a tremor that damaged a statue at a local temple. In a peacekeeping measure, Vishkar sent its top architech to repair the damages. Instead of providing a mere symbolic gesture, Symmetra spent time with Tekhartha Zenyatta and other Shambali pilgrims residing there. Her experience with the Shambali inspired her to repair a damaged statue with her unique weaving of hard-light and original material. Symmetra believes her actions—and those of Vishkar—serve the greater good in society.

Torbjörn had a deep mistrust of sentient robotic intelligence, and while many of his peers wrote this off as paranoia, his worst fears were realized when the robot populations of the world turned against their human creators during the Omnic Crisis. Because of his engineering genius, he joined the original Overwatch strike team, and his many inventions proved integral to ending the crisis. In the years that followed, Overwatch became an international peacekeeping force, and Torbjörn remained a critical resource for all of its technological needs and signature weapons systems.

In Europe, his daughter Brigitte chose to carry on his legacy by serving as squire and armorer for Reinhardt Wilhelm, who continues to fight on the side of justice. And in his native Sweden, Torbjörn came face to face with an oddly peaceful Bastion unit that threw his jaded perspective into disarray. The once-lethal killing machine had befriended local wildlife, inexplicably growing beyond its original wartime protocols. Torbjörn “adopted” the curious Bastion unit, and their close relationship led the engineer to question his antipathy toward robots, AI, and omnics.

In addition, it gave Tracer the ability to control her own time, allowing her to speed it up and slow it down at will. With her newfound skills, she became one of Overwatch's most effective agents. Tracer’s first mission took place in London, where she and her team successfully halted the Null Sector forces involved in the King’s Row uprising. It was the start of a stellar career: she would go on to help apprehend a valuable contact of Talon, Maximilien, in Havana. With the lead Maximilien had given them, Tracer’s strike team then put Talon’s leader, Doomfist, behind bars.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blte4d5570ae276d3f4/6388105b273de01068bb280e/tracer-01.jpg"},{"title":"Post overwatch","content":"Following the disbandment of Overwatch, Tracer was dissatisfied with her quiet life, of replacing heroism with a desk job in the Royal Air Force. Shortly after leaving the military, an encounter with a like-minded omnic named Iggy led Tracer to the Underworld, where her eyes were opened to the harsh conditions the omnic population of London resided in. Assisting in repairs on the Underworld's Grid earned her an audience with the leader of the Shambali, Tekhartha Mondatta, though disaster was soon to follow. Tensions between humans and omnics boiled over when Widowmaker’s crosshairs fell on Mondatta. Though Tracer was present at the event and even fought the sniper, she was unsuccessful in thwarting the assassination. The response was explosive and immediate—Mondatta’s message of peace drowned out in a sea of pain and stolen hope. When an omnic with possible ties to Null Sector stepped forward to rally the omnics of the Underworld in a full-blown revolution against humans, it was only through the combined efforts of Tracer, Winston, and Iggy that no one else was hurt.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blte9360f1cb69cf0de/6388105b443fa70e71d4bfd1/tracer-02.jpg"},{"title":"Recall","content":"Though she was grievously wounded in the process, Tracer can always be counted on to bounce back. With the help of Winston and her partner, Emily, Tracer made a full recovery, rejoining Winston and answering his Overwatch recall broadcast. Though she failed to stop Widowmaker in London, she thwarted the sniper in reclaiming Doomfist’s gauntlet in New York. And in Paris, Tracer was there to repel Null Sector, helping the newly re-formed Overwatch put a stop to any threat to peace.

Her path would take a more interesting turn when she married the great love of her life, Gérard Lacroix, an Overwatch agent spearheading operations against the Talon terrorist organization.

Gerard devoted Overwatch’s every resource to recovering his bride, and it wasn’t long before the operation produced results. His agents saved Amélie, and a medical and psychological evaluation after the kidnapping found her to be apparently no worse for wear. Their official assessment proved fatally inaccurate two weeks later . . . when they discovered she had killed Gérard in his sleep. Overwatch had never truly rescued Amélie Lacroix. They had merely delivered Widowmaker to her first victim. Afterward, Amélie was hunted by police and Overwatch alike, but more than that, she was haunted by the way murdering her husband had made her feel. The moment of the kill was the most alive Amélie had ever felt.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blteec179d006096c80/638810adf9f61910b4235893/widowmaker-01.jpg"},{"title":"Talon","content":"With few other options left, Amélie returned to Talon, chasing the high that had both thrilled and terrified her. At her behest, she was given extensive training in the covert arts and agreed to participate in an experimental marksman program. Talon’s geneticist, Moira O’Deorain, altered Amélie’s physiology to improve her aim, drastically slowing her heart, which turned her skin cold and blue, and numbed her ability to experience human emotion. It dulled the pain of what she’d done, while heightening the charge she felt on the hunt. Now as Widowmaker, she is Talon's most effective assassin. She shot (and had presumably killed) Captain Ana Amari—then the second in command of Overwatch—during a mission in Poland. Shortly after, she assisted the Reaper and Sombra in securing Dr. Siebren de Kuiper for Talon’s ends. More recently she was sighted at the Overwatch Museum in New York, attempting to steal the Doomfist gauntlet; in Russia, at the near-assassination of the head of Volskaya Industries; and in Venice, where her handiwork was apparent amid the murders of Augusto Vialli and his associates. But Widowmaker is perhaps most notorious for her assassination of the Shambali leader, Tekhartha Mondatta at a rally for peace in King’s Row. Though she was intercepted by former Overwatch agent, Tracer, even the hero couldn’t keep Widowmaker from claiming her prize.

While Hammond landed in Australia and settled among the Junkers, Winston found a new home with Overwatch, an organization that represented everything he had come to admire about humanity. Winston was finally able to live up to the heroic ideal that had been instilled in him. At Overwatch, Winston developed the chronal accelerator technology that anchored Tracer to the present.

Inspired by their success in London, Winston remained hopeful that other ex-Overwatch agents would respond to his recall. He and Tracer embarked on a series of missions while they awaited their former comrades, even thwarting Widowmaker and Reaper in a high-profile attack on the Overwatch Museum in New York. But over a year from the recall, only Mei had joined them at Watchpoint: Gibraltar. When Winston intercepted news of the Null Sector attack in Paris, he realized it was likely to be Overwatch’s final battle. But Winston’s patience and faith were not in vain, as Genji, Mercy, Echo, Brigitte, and Reinhardt joined the fight. As more former Overwatch agents (and new blood) step forward to answer the call, Winston remains the steadfast beacon of a future worth fighting for.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt4df2b92421b1ea3f/638810d75148880e83ab70d7/winston-02.jpg"}]}},{"heroKey":"wrecking-ball","name":"Wrecking Ball","description":"A resourceful and highly intelligent mechanic and fighter, Wrecking Ball rose from the laboratories of Horizon Lunar Colony to become the Junker Queen’s champion.","portrait":"https://d15f34w2p8l1cc.cloudfront.net/overwatch/5c18e39ce567ee8a84078f775b9f76a2ba891de601c059a3d2b46b61ae4afb42.png","role":"tank","location":"Horizon Lunar Colony (formerly), Junkertown (formerly)","birthday":"Oct 15","age":16,"hitpoints":{"health":450,"shields":150,"armor":175,"total":775},"abilities":[{"name":"Quad Cannons","description":"Automatic assault weapons.","icon":"https://d15f34w2p8l1cc.cloudfront.net/overwatch/12339775bfc5bfb8a4ad735a2eef452992e90f5374d341baf09f19bc9968147a.png","video":{"thumbnail":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt893d0f77a64b95f3/6339092eed7dcc6a002803f0/WRECKING_BALL_QUAD_CANNONS.jpg","link":{"mp4":"https://assets.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/blt8550acccbd724c51/63390933ec7e18758be510a2/OVERWATCH_WEBSITE_CHARACTER_CAPTURE_WreckingBallQuadCannons_WEB_16x9_1920x1080p30_H264.mp4","webm":"https://assets.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/bltd0d5d37cfa87c437/633909331a0b5e7d3d1ec5fb/OVERWATCH_WEBSITE_CHARACTER_CAPTURE_WreckingBallQuadCannons_WEB_16x9_1920x1080p30_WEBM.webm"}}},{"name":"Grappling Claw","description":"Launch a grappling claw to rapidly swing around the area.

In one stroke, she became a sergeant in the Russian Defense Forces and a symbol to her people, a stalwart soldier who used her great strength to protect her homeland. She was given an experimental weapon by Katya Volskaya, CEO of Volskaya Industries. Her particle cannon was deemed too heavy for standard soldiers, but it also required the kind of quick maneuvering and accuracy that Russia’s mechanized force couldn’t achieve. Zarya fought on the front lines, and saved many lives with the weapon. However, in the wake of an unsuccessful assassination plot against Katya Volskaya by Talon operatives, Zarya was given a new mission: bring the Talon-affiliated hacker, Sombra, to justice. In her global search, Zarya was forced to partner with an omnic named Lynx Seventeen. The unlikely duo located Sombra in Dorado, though she slipped through their fingers after revealing that Katya was obtaining her anti-omnic technology from an omnic source. Grappling with the weight of this knowledge—and with a newfound appreciation of omnics thanks to Lynx—Zarya returned to the front lines in Siberia.","picture":"https://images.blz-contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/bltf0f8d24eb5c5d03c/637da229a4a28e10bf84d70a/zarya-01.jpg"},{"title":"Siberian front","content":"When the search for new Overwatch operatives brought Cassidy to the frozen front in Novoanskoye, Zarya's unflinching defense of her homeland proved that he had found his newest recruit.

After many years of meditation on the nature of existence, they came to the belief that they were more than artificial intelligences and that, like humans, they possessed the essence of a soul. Recognizing the spiritual equality they held with humans, the monks, led by their leader, Tekhartha Mondatta, sought to heal the wounds caused by the Omnic Crisis a generation earlier and bring humans and robots back into societal harmony. Their message was embraced by millions around the world, and they became global celebrities.

In time, Zenyatta helped his student see both his trials and his cybernetic form as a unique strength. But after Genji left his tutelage, Zenyatta began to see the limits of the Shambali path.

Zenyatta met with Satya Vaswani—Symmetra—whom the company had dispatched to fix the issue, sharing Aurora’s story and opening her eyes to the beauty of imperfection. Little did Satya know that Zenyatta had come to the temple in Suravasa to mourn and meditate on the loss of his master, Tekhartha Mondatta, who had been assassinated in King’s Row. Her gift to the people of the temple meant a great deal to him and to all the pilgrims there.
